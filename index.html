            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new
                ideas
                such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational
                skills. Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal
                education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims
                and
                objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is
                compulsory
                up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school
                and
                secondary school.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">It is proved that a countryâ€™s development is primarily based on its
                people and its resources. However, it ultimately
                depends on the people only, as to what extent they can use the scarce resources efficiently in order to
                achieve a rapid
                rate of development and breakthroughs in innovation. As people play the most important role in shaping
                the status of the
                country; education is responsible for shaping a person. Therefore, education is the backbone of any
                country, it plays a
                crucial role in technological developments and imparts various skills, values, and awareness. If a
                country has a higher
                literacy rate, it will lead to a lower unemployment rate and greater GDP growth.</p>
